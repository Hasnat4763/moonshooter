# moonshooter

Moonshooter is a space themed Alien Shooter Game made using Godot
All the Sprites are self Made by me on Blockbench(Cuz I have a working Wakatime Plugin for it)

The theme here is, Moon had its underground society who is trying to invade Earth, you are the only one that people rely on. So leave an impact and destroy those lunar crafts and defend Earth!
